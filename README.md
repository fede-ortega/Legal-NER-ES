# Legal Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Spanish

Notebook for legal Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Spanish as part of the course contents of _Aplicaciones de la Lingüística Computacional_ (Applied Computational Linguistics).

Two types of entities have been noted: 
1. **Organizations (ORG)**: within this category, it is important to underline the importance of the correference to organizations in legal texts, since it is common practice to define the parties to an agreement or that appear in a document and later refer to one of the parties by means of an abbreviated proper name.
2. **Entities related to legislation (LEGAL)**: not only laws are included, but also royal decrees, decisions, regulations, treaties and orders.
